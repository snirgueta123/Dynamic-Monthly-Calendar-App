# Digital Calendar Application

## Overview

This application is a **digital calendar** designed to help users manage their schedules. The calendar is displayed in a table format, with each day of the month represented by a clickable button. Users can select the month, year, and specific day to add, view, or edit appointments.

The appointments are stored in a **HashMap** or **TreeMap**, where the date is the key and the value is the list of meetings scheduled for that day. This provides an efficient way to manage appointments and ensure easy retrieval and updates.

## Features

- **Interactive Calendar**: View and select any month and year to display the corresponding calendar with clickable days.
- **Appointment Management**: Add, view, edit, and delete appointments for any selected day.
- **Text-Based Scheduling**: Users can enter free-text meeting descriptions, and the system will store and display them for easy reference.
- **Date Handling**: Uses Java's `Calendar` class for date manipulation, ensuring accurate handling of months, days, and weekdays.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for managing your schedule with minimal effort.

## Requirements

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or higher
- **IDE**: Any Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.)
- **Libraries**: The program uses built-in Java libraries (`java.util.HashMap`, `java.util.TreeMap`, `java.util.Calendar`).

## How to Use

1. **Start the Application**: Launch the program, and the current month will be displayed by default.
2. **Select a Month and Year**: Choose any month and year from the provided controls.
3. **Click a Day**: Click on any day to view or edit existing appointments.
4. **Add/Edit Appointments**: For each day, you can add or modify appointments, including time details.
5. **View Appointments**: The calendar will show a list of scheduled appointments when a specific day is selected.

## Data Storage

Appointments are stored in a **HashMap** (or **TreeMap**) with the **date** as the key and **appointment details** as the value. This enables efficient management of scheduled events and easy retrieval or updates.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Core language for the application.
- **Java Swing**: (If GUI is implemented) for the graphical user interface.
- **HashMap/TreeMap**: For storing and retrieving appointments efficiently.
- **Calendar API**: For accurate date handling and manipulation.

## Future Enhancements

- **Reminder Notifications**: Add functionality to remind users of upcoming appointments.
- **Recurring Events**: Enable users to set recurring appointments for specific dates (e.g., weekly, monthly).
- **Export/Import**: Allow users to export and import their calendar data.
